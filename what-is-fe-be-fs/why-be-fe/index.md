# What We Teach at Turing and Why

## Turing is Shifting to a Single Software Development Program
Starting with our July 2024 cohort, we’re taking the best ideas from our previous programs and creating one powerful Software Engineering program. The four modules will go like this:

**Module 1 - Object-Oriented Programming**
When students come in we have to build the foundation. We’ll use Ruby with a bit of Javascript to explore how code works and what Object-Oriented programming is all about. How we use basics like variables, control flow, and iterators and combine them with patterns of practice like planning, pseudocoding, refactoring, and source control. We’ll do it in a mix of project-based work solo, in pairs, and in groups. By the end of Mod 1, students will be competent at writing code.

**Module 2 - Web Application Development**
The Model-View-Controller approach is a powerful way to build modern web applications. Using Rails, we’ll work through the key concepts and build functional full-stack applications. Along the way, we lean further into Javascript both as a comparison to the work we're doing on the back end as well as starting to implement some things client side. By the end of the module, students are building and deploying respectable full-stack applications.

**Module 3 - Professional Web Applications**
The modern web application is complex — it’s integrating data from external APIs, Generative AI, multiple databases, and feeding that all to a rich front end. In Module 3, students step beyond the simple one-language-one-framework monolith and juggle multiple domains of responsibility. To build truer full-stack applications, they’re working in at least two languages and two frameworks. It’s a picture of what work in the field looks like — taking what you know from one tech and applying it in new domains.

**Module 4 - Cross-Team Processes and Applications**
Then, in Module 4, students will choose to "major" in Front End with Javascript/React or Back End with Ruby/Rails. But we'll also emphasize branching out – maybe an FEE major decides to specialize in Angular or a BEE student dives into Python and Django. Along the way, they collaborate in teams on bigger Capstone projects that can mix and maximize all their diverse interests. And we’re excited to integrate outside experts to offer special sessions on subjects like Site Reliability Engineering, SDET, and Application Monitoring and Performance.

## Sample Projects

At Turing, we teach through projects. In Mods 1 - 3, you will complete 3 - 4 projects each Mod, allowing you to experience real software development.

## What Type of Jobs Can I Expect to Get?

Here is a list of job titles some of our alumni have gotten:

- Full Stack Developer
- Software Engineer
- Associate Software Engineer
- Junior Backend Developer
- Data Analyst
- Developer
- Software Developer
- Quality Engineer
- Front-End Developer

Our students are prepared to enter the field of software development, period. If you can understand the concepts and the fundamentals and ***how*** everything is working, then you can pick up other languages and frameworks. They all essentially work the same, the syntax, or ***how*** the languages are written is just different.
