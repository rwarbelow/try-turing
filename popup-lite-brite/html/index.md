# Modifying the Lite-Brite HTML

## Tour the Existing Code

- Elements that live inside of the `HTML` file will be displayed on the page.

### Explore to Learn:

- Look at the browser section (the lower portion of the page) - how many Lite-Brite "dots" are being displayed? Can you identify the code that created those dots?
- While your cursor is on line 13, use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + /` (Mac) or `ctrl + /` (PC) to _comment out_ that line of code. What changes do you see in the browser? What does that teach you about what line 13 does? (When finished exploring, _uncomment_ line 13 with the same shortcut.)

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Modify the Existing Code</h2>
  <p>Now that we're getting to know HTML and this specific project a bit better, let's modify it!</p>
  <p><strong>Add 5-10 additional dots to your Lite-Brite board.</strong></p>
</div>

## HTML Summary

- Elements that live inside of the `html` body will be displayed on the page.
- The number of elements and the content inside of the elements in the HTML body usually have a one-to-one correlation with what we see in the browser.
- Every little character matters. The browser can't assume anything about what we want it to do.
